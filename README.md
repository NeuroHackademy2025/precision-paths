# **Precision Paths**
## An Aggregated, Curated, & Itemized Collection of Open and Available Precision Functional Mapping (PFM) from Resting State fMRI Data

## What is PFM?
We borrow our primary definition from previous work.
> "PFM is the precise characterization of individual brain function, currently made possible by the collection of hours of non-invasive fMRI data from an individual, typically collected over multiple visits. PFM relies on large amounts of resting state or task fMRI data in order to extract highly reliable, individualized estimates of brain function and functional connectivity (FC), which allow for the creation of high-resolution, high-fidelity individual-specific maps of functional brain networks or activation." [(Demeter & Greene, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01941-z)[^1]

### How do we parameterize PFM for this dataset?

## Ongoing Data Aggregation
Building a GitHub Repository for Precision (Functional Mapping) Datasets: [Lit Review Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMnbptWr2mAtJtoK5vAUa3AvqwJfOTWLE0lrchhi25w/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Goals:
- Summary and Graphical Figure of released PFM datasets as a function of target sample age [reference](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09519-6/figures/1)
- GitHub Repository with 
  - Links to original articles
  - Links to open datasets
- Summarize Preprocessing Steps and key parameters for each dataset (to facilitate cross-dataset comparisons)
- Future Plan: Periodic updates as more data become available and gaps in the literature are filled

## Other useful resources
- Lit Review Spreadsheet is an updated version of [Gratton et al (2019)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7203002/)
