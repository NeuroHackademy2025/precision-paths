Building a GitHub Repository for Precision (Functional Mapping) Datasets: [Lit Review Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZMnbptWr2mAtJtoK5vAUa3AvqwJfOTWLE0lrchhi25w/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Goals:
- Summary and Graphical Figure of released PFM datasets as a function of target sample age [reference](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09519-6/figures/1)
- GitHub Repository with 
  - Links to original articles
  - Links to open datasets
- Summarize Preprocessing Steps and key parameters for each dataset (to facilitate cross-dataset comparisons)
- Future Plan: Periodic updates as more data become available and gaps in the literature are filled

## Other useful resources
- Lit Review Spreadsheet is an updated version of [Gratton et al (2019)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7203002/)
